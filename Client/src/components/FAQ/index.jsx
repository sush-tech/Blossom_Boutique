              Yes, we absolutely do! At Lovingly, we understand that sometimes you need to send a special gift in a hurry. That's why we offer same-day delivery on many of our arrangements. 
              Just place your order, and we'll make sure your thoughtful gift reaches its destination the very same day. Please keep in mind that the delivery cut-off times may vary based on location and availability. 
              Typically if you get your order in before 2pm in the time zone you are sending to, youâ€™ll still have same-day delivery available!
